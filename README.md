First Feature of the Tic tac toe

# Object-Oriented Programming - Tic Tac Toe Game

> We build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It uses the bubble sort methodology
  We also create a similar method called #bubble_sort_by which sorts an array by accepting a block.

# Tic Tac Toe Instructions

The object of the game is to be the first player to get three in a row. 
Each player picks a symbol to represent them X's or O's. Alternating turns each player picks one empty space and place their symbol in it.  The first player to get three in a row horizontally vertically or diagonally wins.  
Once all the spaces are filled if there is no winner than it is a draw.  
Play the best of three alternating who takes the first turn.

# How to play the game
1- Start the game by executing: ./main.rb inside the repository /bin folder
2- Select New Game by Typing '1'(if you wish to exit type the word 'exit')
3- After selecting option 1 (new game), the program will ask for each player's name.
4- After the names are introduced, the game will show the board scheme you should follow to enter your moves, and prompt each game to enter a move.

Board Scheme (its the map you will be using to select positions on the board)
   1 | 2 | 3 
   4 | 5 | 6 
   7 | 8 | 9 

4- If you want to select position 1 in the board. Type '1' and hit <enter>, when your name is prompted to enter your move.
5- After you enter your move, the program will show an empty board with a mark in the position you wanted to place your move.

(Remember : The object of the game is to be the first player to get three in a row.)

6- When either play completes the objective of creating a row with their positions the game will congratulate the winner!
Otherwise if no player has won and all the positions are filled the game will be declared a draw!

7- You will be asked if you want to play again , type 'Y' or 'N' for yes and no.
