First Feature of the Tic tac toe

# Object-Oriented Programming - Tic Tac Toe Game

> We build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It uses the bubble sort methodology
  We also create a similar method called #bubble_sort_by which sorts an array by accepting a block.

# Tic Tac Toe Instructions

The object of the game is to be the first player to get three in a row. 
Each player picks a symbol to represent them X's or O's. Alternating turns each player picks one empty space and place their symbol in it.  The first player to get three in a row horizontally vertically or diagonally wins.  
Once all the spaces are filled if there is no winner than it is a draw.  
Play the best of three alternating who takes the first turn.

# How to play the game
1- Start the game by executing: ./main.rb inside the repository /bin folder
2- Type '1' and hit the key <enter>, to select New Game or type the word 'exit' to exit the game.
3- After selecting option 1 (new game), the program will ask for each player's name.
4- After the names are introduced, the game will show the board scheme you should follow to enter your moves, and prompt each game to enter a move.

Board Scheme
   1 | 2 | 3 
   4 | 5 | 6 
   7 | 8 | 9 

4- If you want to select position 1 in the board. Type '1' and hit <enter>, when your name is prompted to enter your move.
5- After you enter your move, the program will show an empty board with a mark in the position you wanted to place your move.



## Built With

- Ruby

## Live Demo

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/canriquez/bubble_sort)](https://repl.it/github/canriquez/bubble_sort)


## Getting Started

You can use the Repl.it link above to test the functionalities of the sorting method we created. 


To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
    - You need to have ***Ruby*** installed on your machine ([Check this out](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) for instructions on installing ruby)

### Usage
    To run the code go to the local folder where you have the *Ruby file* and run in the terminal `$ ruby file.rb` being 'file' the one you want to run

### Run tests
    - On the first method (`:bubble_sort`) you can change the given array where you call the method (just after the method definition).
    - On the second one (`:bubble_sort_by`) you can change the words inside the array (remember to separate them with spaces).
